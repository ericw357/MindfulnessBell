A new Sangha is added about every two or three weeks. Following the process below helps ensure that the data entered is understood by the computer and shown for people searching for the new Sangha using the map on the website

1. Make sure that the data is clean so that computers can understand it. Preferrably it will contain: address, city, state, zip, country
2. For fusion tables: Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/SunyataZero/MindfulnessBell/blob/master/creating-a-fusion-map.md) (a new fusion map needs to be created each time a new map point is added)
3. Verify that the new Sangha can be seen in the newly generated map
